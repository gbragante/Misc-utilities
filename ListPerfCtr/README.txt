ListPerfCtr.exe

This small utility lists all available performance counters and instances.
It is useful when you have to write scripts or programs referencing a performance counter with long and complex names.

Instructions:
Copy the binary file ListPerfCtr.exe on your local hard disk, then run it from a command prompt window.

For better result I suggest to redirect the output to a file:

ListPerfCtr.exe > counters.txt

The utility was developed with Visual Basic .NET Express edition, full source code included in the src folder
